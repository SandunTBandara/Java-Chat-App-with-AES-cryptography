# Java-Chat-App-with-AES-cryptography
Java Chat App with AES cryptography. I create this simple chat application to practice AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
-> The use of two keys has consequences in: key  distribution, confidentiality and authentication.
-> A public-key, which may be known by anybody, and  can be used to encrypt messages, and verify  signatures
-> A private-key, known only to the recipient, used to decrypt messages, and sign (create) signatures
-> Those who encrypt messages or verify signatures cannot decrypt messages or create signatures
